CATV (Cards Against The Void) is a fast, minimal command-line tool for turning your notes into interactive flashcards and reviewing them with spaced repetition. Simply point CATV at your folder of markdown notes, and it uses Ollama's local AI models (LLMs) to automatically generate flashcards and quiz you in a colorful terminal interface. CATV is written in Go for minimal dependencies—all you need is the Ollama client app from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) and the compiled binary from this repository. No cloud, no subscriptions, no hidden costs.

**Why CATV?**
- Effortlessly convert your markdown notes into flashcards using local AI (LLM)
- Review and reinforce knowledge with spaced repetition
- Enjoy a distraction-free, user-friendly terminal experience
- 100% private: your notes and flashcards never leave your device
- Secure and offline: no internet required, no data sent to third parties
- Free and open-source: no hidden costs or paywalls

Designed for simplicity, privacy, and security, working entirely offline and storing your cards locally in SQLite. Originally built and tested for macOS, it runs anywhere Ollama is supported.

## Quick Start

1. **Install Ollama Desktop:**
  - Download and install from [ollama.com](http://ollama.com/)

2. **Pull the llama3.1 model:**
  ```bash
  ollama pull llama3.1
  ```

3. **Download and set up(for MacBook M2, adjust as needed):**
  ```bash
  curl -L https://github.com/luiz1361/catv/releases/latest/download/catv-darwin-arm64 -o catv
  chmod +x catv && xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine catv
  ```

4. **Generate flashcards from your markdown notes:**
  ```bash
  ./catv generate --path <path-to-your-markdown-files>
  ```

5. **Review your flashcards:**
  ```bash
  ./catv
  ```

That's it! No extra configuration needed. It will use the local Ollama API and store flashcards in a SQLite database.
